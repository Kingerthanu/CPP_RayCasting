# RayCasting
Old project where I was testing Some russian video on Raycasting. You kinda walk fast to watch out on that. I have been slowly making raycasters and stopping midway through on languages like C++ as I've been moving languages but may try with OpenGL next as I see C++ as my primary language. Still probably one of my nicer looking rasters amidst its spaghetti.
