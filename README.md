# RayCasting
Old project where I was testing Some russian video on Raycasting.

You kinda walk fast to watch out on that. I have been slowly making raycasters and stopping midway through on languages like C++ as I've been moving languages but may try with OpenGL next as I see C++ as my primary language. Still probably one of my nicer looking rasters amidst its spaghetti.

**The Breakdown:**

  This Program Works With Python And Its Pygame Library To Generate A Raycasting Engine Based Upon A 2D-Voxel-Map.

  While This Project Is Quite Dull In Features, It Was My First Actual PROJECT Where I Saw Myself Making A Multi-Object Program With More Intuitive Design And Modularity. While I Did Follow A Russian Video That I Couldn't Understand, At Least He Wrote His Code In English So It Really Challenged Me To Really Interpret What He Was Doing And Why. I Think This Really Benefitted Me In Development In My Later Projects As Coming Out Of This I Generally Saw How Windows ACTUALLY Work As Well As How We Draw A Window With Some Shape/Design. While Previously I Thought It Was Some Black Magic Voodoo WitchCraft, It Was Intruiging To See Actually How We Request Something Like A Window To Draw A Square Throughout These Given Coordinates With "R,G,B" Color Values.

  This Video Also Taught Me A Lot Of Good-Practice Decisions As Making Constants For Our Player Settings In Their Own File Was A Smart Move As It Allowed For A Non-Volatile Session Of Our Game. While This Isn't Really Necessary In Something Quite Hard-Coded As This Program In Its Current State, It Did At Least Get Me Comfortable With Some Concepts That I Do See Myself Using In Newer More Depthful Projects With Multi-Hierachical Relationships.
